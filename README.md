# Super Store Analysis
  (Using SQL)

Super store dataset which is very commonly used I know but Retail Analysis has been one of my favorites. So I thought of using this dataset and working on improving my Analytical thinking to get as many insights with the existing data.

What all insights will be useful for our stakeholders, are there any hidden patterns in the data that can be analyzed. What problems we can address using this dataset, these are few questions i asked myself before working on getting insights.

## Following are Insights which i derived -

1. Top sales region. (Created View)
2. Percentage Revenue per year.
